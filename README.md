# Microprofile Rest Client with Mutual TLS Authentication
Microprofile Rest Client with Mutual TLS Authentication implemented with Quarkus

TLS authentication is an extension of TLS transport encryption. \
Not only servers have keys and certs that the client uses to verify the identity of servers, clients also have keys and certs that the server uses to verify the identity of clients. You must have TLS transport encryption configured on your cluster before you can use TLS authentication. This guide assumes you already have TLS transport encryption configured.
